#Solvable Games

Features some examples of puzzles solved by the selection monad in Haskell.
Most of the sequentially solved puzzles are Sudoku variations.
Solved in parallel:
  * Sudoku
  * Connect 3 / Connect 4
  * TicTacToe
  * NQueens

Computed sequentially:
  * [Futoshiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futoshiki)
  * [Nonograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram)
  * [Buchstabensalat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchstabensalat_(logic_puzzle))
  * [Inshi no Heya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inshi_no_heya)

The selection monad itself is contained in the module 'GameLogic'.
